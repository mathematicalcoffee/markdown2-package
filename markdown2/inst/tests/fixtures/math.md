For mathjax in the markdown pacakge, you can use expressions `$$ ... $$` and `\[ ... \]` for display maths,
or `$ ... $` or `\( ... \)` or `$latex ... ` for inline maths.
When these appear in code tags they should not be converted to maths!

When \(a \neq 0\), there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Here's another display equation: \[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

And using the double-dollar delimiters (recall that $latex a \neq 0$):

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$
